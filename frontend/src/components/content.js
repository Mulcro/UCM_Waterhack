                                <p>The linear regression model was the most forward approach we initially had but early on we realized that the r-squared value was extremely low making our model inaccurate for predicting what we wanted.</p>

                                <p>Similar to the linear model, it adds polynomial terms to the input variables to model nonlinear relationships between the input and output variables. This increased our accuracy but the r_square value was still extremely low, also making our model inaccurate for predictions.</p>
